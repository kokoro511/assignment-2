  <h2>1. customer mission</h2>
    <p>My design plan is that the most eye-catching part of the homepage is special offers. Customers will be attracted by special offers and increase the desire to buy by young families and young people. Next to special offers are customer reviews, which can increase the favor of new users on the site. Below the menu, click on the menu to jump to a new page to view the food introduction interface and prices. </p>
  <h2>2. Goals </h2>
    <p> The bakery website hopes to attract young people to buy bakery foods through the introduction of signature products and weekly specials, and to place customers' praise to provide reference information for new customers. </p>
  <h2>3. Success evaluation</h2>
    <p>When other advertising methods remain unchanged, the increased number of members and orders after the establishment of the website can be considered as the function of the website. </p>
  <h2>4. Target audience</h2>
    <p>The target audience for my website is young families, young people and students. The way to target the target audience can be to put the discounted products in a more prominent position. </p>
  <h2>5. Site diagram and web design draft</h2>

  <h2>6.  Content analysis</h2>
    <p> After analyzing the customer's email, it is found that the email can be used directly.  </p>
  <h2>7. Images with size and description analysis</h2>
    <p> Looking for the right picture. </p>
  <h2>8. Page design</h2>
    <p> On the left side of the webpage is placed the customer's praise, the webpage prevents multiple horizontal navigation bars from jumping to the product detail page, the webpage is prominently placed on the weekly discount products, and the store contact information and address are placed at the bottom of the webpage. </p>
  <h2>9.Font and style guide - including colors codes. </h2>
    <p> The website uses a white background, a black font (#3B0C14), and the default font is used to keep the web page concise. </p>
  <h2>10.Project timeline.</h2>
    <p>I used about 3 weeks to make a webpage, and invited a classmate and a netizen to participate in the webpage test. </p>
