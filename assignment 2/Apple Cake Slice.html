<p>When it comes to cake recipes, it doesn't get any easier or more delicious than this apple cake! Think... layers of sliced fresh apples and sweet butter cake, topped with crunchy flaked almonds.</p>
<p> Whether you serve it at room temperature, or warmed slightly for dessert (add some cream or ice-cream for the ultimate indulgence!), it's sure to become a family favourite in no time. </p>
<p>This dessert only sells for $ 5.5! </p>
